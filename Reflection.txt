This web page demonstrates how a clean, responsive layout can be achieved using modern CSS Flexbox. By placing the contact form in a sidebar and the employee table in the main content area, the layout becomes visually balanced and more intuitive for users. This separation of content enhances clarity and improves user interaction.

Flexbox provides a powerful way to organize components in a flexible two-column structure. It adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, making the layout responsive without requiring complex media queries. The use of flex-wrap ensures that the layout remains user-friendly even on smaller devices by stacking the columns when needed.

The integration of various HTML elements — such as forms, tables, and an iframe — showcases how modular design can create a cohesive and interactive experience. Each component serves a distinct purpose, yet they work harmoniously within the overall design.

Additionally, the consistent styling and the use of semantic HTML tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer> contribute to better accessibility and code readability. This approach supports good development practices, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend in the future.

Overall, this project highlights the effectiveness of combining semantic HTML with CSS Flexbox to create structured, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces.
